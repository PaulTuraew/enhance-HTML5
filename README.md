# enhance-HTML5
Custom design and build chart for learning all about HTML5.

This is a sort of sandbox I am building to play with advanced features of CSS3 and HTML5. The subject matter will be the mozilla-documented elements, links and descriptions.
It is an attempt to effectively present information but in a fun/playful way.
